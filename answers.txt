Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: We might consider using git because it has version control capabilities
that make it easier to manage code and collaborate with other programmers on the
same project. Git features include the ability to pull, push, create and checkout
branches, create pull requests, create merge requests and resolve merge conflicts,
etc., all of which allow us to maintain our code in a more organized and efficient
manner.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give and Example and how it might help

Answer: Data science can be applied to any field that relies on handling large
datasets to make informed decisions. For example, data science can be applied to
the field of healthcase. This is because data science and analysis methods can be 
applied on hospital or patient data to help healthcare professionals
potentially understand the correlation between certain symptoms and diagnoses, 
ultimately allowing them to make smarter decisions about treatment options.


Q3: What is the difference between merging and rebasing?

Answer: The difference between merging and rebasing is that merging combines the 
changes present in one branch into another branch, but it does so by combining the 
histories of the two branches together. Rebasing, however, adds all of the
changes of the feature branch to the top of the main branch. Thus when rebasing, the
histories are not combined, but rather the history of the main branch is rewritten
by the feature branch.
