Q1: Why might be consider using git?

Answer: We might consider using git because it has version control capabilities
that make it easier to manage code and collaborate with other programmers on the
same project. Git features include the ability to pull, push, create and checkout
branches, create pull requests, create merge requests and resolve merge conflicts,
etc., all of which allow us to maintain our code in a more organized and efficient
manner.
